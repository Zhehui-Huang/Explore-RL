# Discuss about REINFORCE algorithms
REINFORCE paper:  [Benchmarking Deep Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.06778.pdf).
## Implemented Algorithms

If we compared with with_baseline.txt and without_baseline.txt, we can found that for the version with baseline, the average rewards increasing more stable compared with without baseline version.
